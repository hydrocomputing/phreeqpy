# PhreeqPy: Python Tools for PHREEQC

PhreeqPy provides Python tools to work with
[PHREEQC]((http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/index.html)).

Currently it provides access to the
[IPhreeqc]ftp://brrftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/charlton/iphreeqc/IPhreeqc.pdf
interface without the need to run a COM server and therefore also works on
non-Windows systems.
IPhreeqc is described in more detail in this
[publication](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300411000653).
This
[publication at the conference MODFLOW and More 2011](http://igwmc.mines.edu/conference/schedule.html)
demonstrates with an example how PhreeqPy works.
